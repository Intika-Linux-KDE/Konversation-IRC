Changes from 0.18 to 0.19
We are extremely pleased to announce the immediate release of Konversation 0.19. The focus
of this release is on extending and improving upon established functionality. Most notable
in this regard are significantly improved management of IRC networks and servers all across
the application, a redesigned tab bar and better support for common IRC commands. A long
list of further additions and improvements has us confident of this being the best version
of Konversation yet. Enjoy!


User Interface
* The Server List dialog has been rewritten to allow direct manipulation of a network's
  servers and features more intelligent sorting behavior. Reordering networks via drag
  and drop is now possible. A behavioral audit of all actions in the dialog resulted in
  numerous improvements.
* A redesigned tab bar sports highly configurable text- and LED icon-based notifications
  as well as more intelligent scaling behavior under space-critical conditions.
* Tabs are now intelligently grouped around their respective connection status tab.
* Status tab labels now display the user-configured network name where appropriate.
* The Find Text dialog has been replaced by a search bar that no longer interrupts your
  workflow.
* Channel links in the chat area now feature a context menu for quick access to common
  actions.
* Usage of the status bar has been extended to show context-relevant information as the
  cursor passes over various interface elements. The lag information segment is now
  only shown where appropriate.
* A channel's topic can now be cleared by setting an empty text in the Channel Options
  dialog.
* The Channel Options dialog has been redesigned to allow editing the current topic
  while browsing a channel's topic history.
* The Watched Nicknames interface has been fully integrated with network management.
* Pressing the Arrow Down key in the input line now preserves any input entered by
  adding it to the history.
* Commands may now be sent as regular messages by typing Ctrl+Enter.
* The multi-line paste editor window now highlights whitespace characters and prepends
  the existing content of the input line.
* The Colored Nicknames feature has been improved to better handle nickname changes and
  immediately apply any changes to the color palette.
* Some previously not configurable notification events have been made configurable.
* Users leaving a server will now be announced in any query you have open with them.
* Query tab labels will now update when a user you have a query open with changes
  his/her name.
* The DCC file transfer dialogs have seen a number of cosmetic improvements. Among other
  things, in the event of a file being renamed on save, the local file name is now shown
  across the application.
* Various status and error messages have been rewritten for improved consistency and
  clarity.
* The KDE standard text font will now be correctly set as initial default chat font.
* It is now possible to skip displaying a server's MOTD on connect.
* If the application is set to display a server's MOTD in a fixed-width font and the
  previously configured default chat font is already a fixed-width font, the chat font
  will now be used rather than the global KDE default fixed-width font.
* The state of the automatic spell checking functionality is now remembered across
  sessions and set for all tabs.
* Networks no longer lose their channel history when their settings are changed.
* The Server List dialog will no longer close when a connection attempt fails due to
  the identity not being set up correctly.
* After changing your nickname using the optional drop-down menu to the left of the
  input line, focus will now be returned to the input line.
* The configuration dialog has been rewritten to correctly update the button state of
  its primary actions and improve consistency with the KDE style guide.
* The vertical and horizontal splitters in channel tabs now behave better when the
  application window is resized and correctly retain their positions across sessions.
* The OSD preview in the OSD settings page is now always shown correctly.
* The OSD will no longer be shown when the desktop is locked.
* A bug that prevented copying text from the chat area under certain circumstances has
  been fixed.
* Keyboard search in the channel nickname list has been fixed.
* A number of issues affecting nickname context menus in the chat area have been fixed.
* A bug leading to a wrong operator count in the status bar has been fixed.
* It is no longer possible to add nameless networks or hostless servers in the respon-
  sible management dialogs.
* Bugs that led to parts of the interface not reacting to KDE color scheme changes have
  been fixed.
* The status bar now correctly reacts to KDE font size changes.
* A bug that led to the application window resizing on overly long status bar contents
  has been fixed.
* A bug that led to multiple remember lines being inserted into the frontmost tab when
  away mode was activated has been fixed.
* A bug that led to wrong link addresses being opened from the chat area has been fixed.
* Bugs that led to wrong URLs being produced by dragging a link from the chat area to
  the input line have been fixed.
* Channel names are now better recognized as such by the chat area.


Bookmarking
* Bookmark titles now default to the channel name.
* Bookmarks now store the network name rather than the server address where available.
* Bookmarks now support IPv6 addresses.


Commands
* The '/server' command now recognizes a greater variety of address notations including
  network names.
* The '/names' command now always succeeds in returning the user list of a channel.
* The '/topic' command now always succeeds in returning the topic of a channel.

  tive server.

  the respective context.

* A bug in parsing the arguments of the '/join' command has been fixed.
* Usage information and error reporting for various commands has been rewritten for
  improved consistency and clarity.
* A bug that led to a 'clear' command being sent to the server when using the '/clear'
  command to clear the contents of a query tab has been fixed.


Miscellaneous
* The 'media' script has been rewritten and now features improved compatibility with
  common character sets, greatly enhanced support for the Kaffeine media player and
  newly added support for the Yammi media player.
* The 'sysinfo' script has been rewritten to produce more concise output and better
  handle a variety of storage scenarios.
* The convenience feature expanding [[term]] into a Wikipedia link is now localizable
  and generates a link that performs an intelligent lookup for the term in the Wiki-
  pedia rather than assume a correct direct link.


Technology
* Konversation now depends on KDE 3.4+.
* The preferences storage system has been rewritten to facilitate easier maintenance
  and faster development in future release cycles.
* Localized support for a long list of IRC protocol primitives has been added.
* The application will now correctly iterate over a network's servers on successive
  failed connection attempts.
* When the '/server' command or the Quick Connect dialog is used to connect to a
  server that has previously been added to a network in the Server List dialog, it
  will be recognized as being part of the network and the respective identity
  settings will be applied.
* The automated reply to a highlight event can now reference the groups of the matched
  pattern by the identifiers %1-%9 and the entire match by the identifier %0.
* The CABAP IDENTIFY-MSG technology is now supported.

  to the specified command when the %u identifier is missing.
* Channel modes are now correctly cleared and updated in the internal representation
  on rejoin.
* A bug that led to an infinite loop during a connection attempt when all nicknames
  configured in the identity were in use has been fixed.
* A bug that could lead to a crash when opening the log file for a closed connection has
  been fixed.
