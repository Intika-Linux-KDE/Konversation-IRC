TODO-list for Konversation
==========================
<nick>  == reported by
-->nick == assigned to
#x      == sequential bug number,
           #1 being the highest available (take this one for your next bug and increase here)


SHORT-TERM (URGENT):
- Limit backlog to x lines or KB
- Make URLs like http://user@somedomain.com/ work
- /WHOWAS after /WHOIS if /WHOIS returns unknown nickname
- Add ETA counter for DCC transfers
- Show / Hide tab types (status tabs ect.)
- Hide all "technical" messages from channels and queries or redirect them into the status view
- Measure away time and make it available via placeholder
- Support "CTCP-DCC reply from <nickname>: REJECT SEND <filename> <reason>"

MID-TERM:
- Make [x] on tabs harder to click (1 second hover delay or similar)
- Doxify the source ( berkus )
- Per nick coloring in channel discussion
- DCC RESUME should start counting cps from the beginning
- Treeview with servers, list of channels / queries in a detachable window that also indicates new text
- After being away a summary of lines with highlighting in its own window would be nice; a click on one line
  might jump to the according line in the channel/query-window
- DCC port range
- In Nicks Online panel, show stats like "last spoken" "last seen"
- Compute md5sum over DCCs and send / display the hash after transfer
- Make separate Highlight lists for each identity

LONG-TERM:
- Logrotate with timer or at shutdown, compress rotated logs ( berkus )
- Context menu on nick in nick list should contain hostmask, realname, etc. infos (in a sub-menu)
- Stats for server lag, words per session per person / channel, quits etc.
- "notices" tab for all notices that are no channel notices
- "snotices" tab for all server notices (prefix without "!" )
- Make LED colors for nick list configurable via GUI
- Detect shell commands and warn the user
- Ban List. A window in which the user can see the bans of a channel(and remove them).


IDEAS:
- Automatically gzip files before DCC SEND
- Multi line behaviour in input line with "little enter"


DISCUSSING:

- The text-search could offer a button "any highlight"
- Check for channel or user parameter in mode changes to take care of duplicate mode chars
- Click on notify messages opens query
- Events for Queries and DCC Chat
- A "channel or topic" checkbox would be nice, or make the current checkboxes work as "or" not as "and"
- Optionally copy log files to new location
- Try to keep open views on kicks and stuff
- Reverse-I-Search
- Pasting into text views should trigger the paste mechanism
- Let the user decide how many quick buttons they want, if at all.
- Replace "0.0.0.0" with QString::null in dccTransfer to allow other than IPv4
- Session management
- Make font for quick buttons configurable
- cycle command
- Nick button in status pane does nothing
- privmsg (/msg) should be logged to the specific log file (if i do "/msg foo bar"
  i want to have this in konversation-foo.log)
- Mark the last point where the panel was active
- Command Char must be present
- Make %k (Channel Key Wildcard) work ... Seems to be a bit complicated
- Show away messages only once per nick
- Tabs on left / right (?)
- Different tab sortings
- Import notify list from .ircrc
- Notify with more than 500 characters
- "Open Nicks online panel on startup" option
