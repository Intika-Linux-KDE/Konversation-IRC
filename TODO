TODO-list for Konversation
==========================

SHORT-TERM (URGENT):
- Show / Hide tab types (status tabs ect.)
- Support "CTCP-DCC reply from <nickname>: REJECT SEND <filename> <reason>"

MID-TERM:
- Doxify the source
- Per nick coloring in channel discussion
- In Watched Nicks panel, show stats like "last spoken" "last seen"
- Compute md5sum over DCCs and send / display the hash after transfer
- Make separate Highlight lists for each identity
- Text substitution list (aliases, dangerous commands) with ability to pop up messageboxes
- Dcop interface for charset
- Ability define multiple commands (bug#88533)
- Full session management support

LONG-TERM:
- Treeview with servers, list of channels / queries in a detachable window that also indicates new text
- Log rotation & maintainance ( Like copying log files to new location )
- Context menu on nick in nick list should contain hostmask, realname, etc. infos (in a sub-menu)
- "notices" tab for all notices that are no channel notices, snotices go to server status tab
- Ban List. A window in which the user can see the bans of a channel(and remove them).
- Use QCA for SSL when KNetwork natively supports it

IDEAS:
- Automatically gzip files before DCC SEND

TODO That Will Be Fixed When Kmdi interface is stable :
- Tabs on left / right (?)
- Detachable queries
- Make [x] on tabs harder to click (1 second hover delay or similar)

DISCUSSING:
- The text-search could offer a button "any highlight"
- Events for Queries and DCC Chat
- Channel List: A "channel or topic" checkbox would be nice, or make the current checkboxes work as "or" not as "and"

- Try to keep open views on kicks and stuff
- Reverse-I-Search
- Pasting into text views should trigger the paste mechanism (Partly implemented, MMB works. psn)
- Let the user decide how many quick buttons they want, if at all.
- cycle command (script)
- Make %k (Channel Key Wildcard) work ... Seems to be a bit complicated
- Show away messages only once per nick
- Different tab sortings
- Import watched nicks list from .ircrc ( cartman: Got sample )
- Notify with more than 500 characters
- Watched nicks editor should sort alphabetically, manual sorting makes no sense there
- Watched nicks panel should have a "last seen" column so you can sort them

NEW (15.08.2004):
- KNotify for kicks / kills
- Add common default aliases (Commands are auto-aliased now. Is that whats wanted here?)
- Right click on email addresses to associate them to the address book entry of user posting it
